# country-borders

Some weekend experimenting with graphs by using country land borders as a dataset.

This repository shows some examples of:

- Displaying graphs with `networkx`/`matplotlib.pyplot`
- Finding the shortest path (BFS) between vertices (e.g. France to China)
- Building a graph of all the non-islands of the world
